An S3-compatible Gateway based on Ceph RGW, using a non-RADOS backend for
standalone usage.

This project provides the required infrastructure to build a container
able to run on a kubernetes cluster, providing S3-compatible endpoints to
applications.

# ðŸ›£ Roadmap

![Roadmap](/assets/images/s3gw-roadmap.jpg)

The aim is to deliver a Minumum Viable Product (MVP). In a nutshell, an MVP seeks to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about our users in a short time.

Based on the user feedback we collect, we develop features that add up towards the goal of delivering the MVP. We're working on phases:

**Phase 1**
* Use SQLite as storage backend.
* Running the s3gw in a container.
* Be able to run basic S3 operations.
* Ability to deploy the S3 Gateway on a K8s or K3s cluster with.
* [Design mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/IeozuvvYlrKBs7qm030dyo/S3-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1) for User management & an S3 explorer.

-----

**Phase 2**
* Basic S3 explorer UI
* Helm chart
* Define & start work on a file-based backend
* Implement CI/CD

-----

**Phase 3**
* File-based backend integration
* Increased support for S3 functional features
* S3 explorer UI
* User management UI
* tba

-----

**Project board**

We track our progress in this [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/aquarist-labs/projects/5/views/1) board.

# ðŸš€ Quickstart
## Helm chart
An easy way to deploy the S3 Gateway on your Kubernetes cluster is via a Helm chart.
We've created a dedicated repository for it, which can be found [here](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/s3gw-charts).

## Docker
```
docker pull ghcr.io/aquarist-labs/s3gw:latest
```

In order to run the Docker container:

```
docker run -p 7480:7480 localhost/s3gw
```

For more information on building and running a container, please read our [guide](./build/).
